# TODO_localization_ROB

Segundo short project de Robotica, FIB, UPC



What to deliver:
A pdf report with figures, commented code and workspace variable you use for implementing the blocks of the suggested architecture.


1 Pose estimated. A figure of a noisy trajectory with the ellipses representing the covariance error in position. Make a zoom in to see in detail. Add to the report the commented code you implemented.
2 Polar 2 Cartesian. A figure of the Land Mark seeing in Robot Reference Frame.
3 Robot to World. Generate the workspace ‘laserW’ variable and and include in the report a figure of the Land Mark seeing in World Reference Frame.
4 Associated Land Mark. Filter out the lidar data by detecting the landMark (datacloud) and Identifying the LandMark (nearest_to). Add to the report a figure with colored Land Mark seeing by the Robot.
5 Similarity Transform. Adapt the Similarity Transform to output the error in pose given a time.
